/<username> <- this is the profile page for the user

For specific health components - could either be a bunch of pre defined health components
EG - diet, fitness, mental, cancer, blood - compile a whole list of all the possible stuff

    CONS - places an expectation on the user to finish all of these, while it is possible for the app to just give an abbreviated model
    PROS - there are none

Oh.
What you could do is, in the server side, have a list of constants that detail the parts of health that is available.
On client side, have a bunch of cards that are mapped from the list of health aspects that the user has that the server gives to the client.
Client can click on the cards to reveal more information on each aspect.

I think you would have to create a file for each and every aspect of health to predict the person's future health status for <int> years later.
